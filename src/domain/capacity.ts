/**
 * Pixel Peeker — capacity maths.
 *
 * THE CENTRAL DISTINCTION, and the thing most spreadsheets get wrong:
 *
 *   1. LINK capacity (how many pixels fit down one output port) is set by
 *      link rate, colour bit depth and FRAME rate. The LED's visual refresh
 *      rate is irrelevant here — the frame arrives once per frame period and
 *      the receiving card re-scans it locally.
 *
 *   2. DRIVE capacity (whether the receiving card can actually paint those
 *      pixels at the wanted refresh) is set by the driver IC clock, the scan
 *      ratio and the panel's internal greyscale depth. Frame rate and input
 *      bit depth are nearly irrelevant here.
 *
 * Mixing the two is why people "lose" capacity at high refresh rates and can't
 * explain where it went. We model them separately and report both.

/**
 * How a vendor packs a pixel onto the wire.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT `3 x bitDepth`, and assuming it is will overstate 10-bit capacity by
 * about 7%. Controllers pack each colour component into a power-of-two container so
 * the DMA engine stays word-aligned, so 10-bit costs the same wire space as 16-bit:
 *
 *   8-bit  -> 8+8+8    packed into 24 bits/px
 *   10-bit -> 10+10+10 packed into 32 bits/px   (not 30)
 *   12-bit -> 12+12+12 packed into 48 bits/px   (not 36)
 *
 * VERIFICATION: this was originally derived from NovaStar's three published MX40 Pro
 * per-port figures at 60 Hz — 659,722 px at 8-bit, 494,791 px at 10-bit and 329,861 px
 * at 10/12-bit — which ONE efficiency constant of exactly 0.9500 reproduces to the
 * pixel with the containers above, and which naive 3 x bitDepth packing fits with no
 * constant at all.
 *
 * It is no longer a derivation. The MX20, MX30, MX2000 Pro and MX6000 Pro
 * specifications print the formula itself:
 *
 *    8bit:  Load capacity x 24 x Frame rate < 1000 x 1000 x 1000 x 0.95
 *   10bit:  Load capacity x 32 x Frame rate < 1000 x 1000 x 1000 x 0.95
 *   12bit:  Load capacity x 48 x Frame rate < 1000 x 1000 x 1000 x 0.95
 *
 * Both constants, stated by the vendor. Nothing here is inferred any more.
 *
 * The same tables also show the 32-bit 10-bit container is a RECEIVING CARD property,
 * not a controller one: NovaStar publish a second table headed "When Working with Other
 * Armor Series Receiving Cards" in which 10-bit costs 48 bits and the per-port figure
 * drops from 494,791 to 329,861. `container` here is therefore the A10s Pro case. See
 * the known gap noted in `receiverCheck`.
 *
 * `container-legacy` is the pre-COEX MCTRL generation, which has no 32-bit path at all:
 * 10-bit costs the full 48 bits whatever card is on the other end. The MCTRL660 PRO
 * datasheet states both of its figures, and they are exactly 2:1 — 650,000 px at 8-bit
 * and 325,000 px at 10/12-bit — which is 24 vs 48 bits and cannot be 24 vs 32.
